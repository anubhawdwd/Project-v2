# Motion Portfolio

A sleek, animated portfolio built with Next.js and Motion One — SEO-optimized and performance-tuned for production.

> Inspired by Manu Arora — his tutorial on Motion One & Next.js was the foundation for this project.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router, TypeScript)
- **Animations:** Motion One (motion/react)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **SEO:** Meta tags, Open Graph, optimized fonts

```
npm install
npm run dev

```

# or

bun dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Development Notes
